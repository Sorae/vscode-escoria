Escoria is a framework for creating Point & Click adventure games in Godot game engine and it uses scripts written in the Escoria language (.esc).
However to this day Escoria is not natively supported by the Godot Editor.

### Disclaimers /!\

* This project is a Work In Progress and its owner is actually still learning how to use Escoria, the Godot game engine and how to make and extension for VSCode. Be nice!

* I am not affiliated with either Godot or the Escoria team. 
This repository and the extension that I deploy to the Visual Studio Marketplace were originally made for my personal use, but I figured it could be useful to someone else. ;)
